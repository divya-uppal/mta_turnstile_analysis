MTA Turnstile Analysis

Owner: Divya Uppal

Abstract:
MacFlurry, a fast food chain, wants to open stores around major subway stations in Manhattan. They want recommendations on where to open their stores depending on long- term sustainability in the sales which is least affected by re-occurrence of Covid. I worked with data provided by MTA for the year 2019,20,21 and analyzed hourly,daily and monthly trends to provide recommendations. I used matplotlib and excel to visualize and communicate my results.

Design:
1. Understanding the problem
2. Data collection
3. Cleaning and management of errorneous,duplicate and null data.
4. Analyzed top 10 stations by average daily entries and calculate year on year % Change
5. Analyzed hourly data to find trends in entry and exit on a daily basis

Data:
MTA Data for the year 2019, 2020 and 2021.

Tools:
- Panda and numpy for data manipulation
- Sql for basic analysis on the data
- Matplotlib for plotting

Conclusion:
I recommend Mac Flurry to open stores near Flushing Main or Jackson Height Roosevelt MTA stations due to following reasons:
- More resilient to restrictions imposed by Covid
- Highest return in MTA Traffic post lockdown
- Higher percentage of workers not WFH
- Low Real Estate Prices
- Post Covid: Average Daily Entries as high as 42 Port Authority Station
